# CS109-Challenge-Project
This repository contains relevant data and code for my CS109 Challenge Project.
The main method for the project is in the Jupyter Notebook: `Project.ipynb`.
Classes for the Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers are in: `project_classifiers.py`

The `project/data` folder contains the training and test sets, formatted as `project_[role]-train.csv` and `project_[role]-test.csv`, respectively.
It also contains `cs109_project_accuracies.csv`, which contains the accuracies of the performances of the models.

The ChEBI dataset for chemical structures used is the `structures_3star.csv.gz` file from the [ChEBI website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/downloadsForward.do).
